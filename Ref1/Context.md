## Case Scenario: End-to-End Delivery Flow

### Sender Flow: Alex's Experience

1. **Authentication & Entry**
   - Alex opens MBet-Adera app and logs in using Google OAuth
   - App loads his saved preferences and delivery history

2. **Creating New Delivery**
   - Taps "New Delivery" on the dashboard
   - Selects package size and type from predefined options
   - Enters basic package details and special handling instructions

3. **Location Selection**
   - Opens interactive map interface
   - Selects nearest pickup point from verified MBet-Adera partners
   - Chooses dropoff location from Beza's saved addresses

4. **Payment Process**
   - Views calculated delivery fee based on distance and package details
   - Chooses to pay from MBet-Adera wallet balance (Options here for Alex include to pay from his MBet-Adera wallet balance, cash on pickup, YenePay, TeleBirr or waive the fee including his own set fee to be paid by Beza,)
   - Confirms payment with fingerprint authentication

### System Processing

1. **Order Creation**
   - System generates unique tracking ID and QR code
   - Creates database entry in Supabase
   - Triggers real-time notifications

2. **Notifications**
   - Alex receives confirmation via push notification
   - Beza (recipient) gets SMS and in-app notification
   - Selected pickup point receives new order alert

### Recipient Flow: Beza's Experience

1. **Order Tracking**
   - Beza receives delivery notification
   - Opens app to view real-time package location
   - Gets estimated delivery time updates

2. **Package Reception**
   - Receives arrival notification when package reaches dropoff point
   - Gets unique verification code via SMS
   - Shows code at pickup point for verification
   - Confirms receipt in app with digital signature

### Technical Implementation

```javascript
// Example: Real-time tracking subscription
const trackingSubscription = supabase
  .from(`parcels:id=eq.${trackingId}`)
  .on('UPDATE', payload => {
    updateParcelLocation(payload.new);
    sendPushNotification(payload.new.status);
  })
  .subscribe();

// Example: Verification code generation
const generateVerificationCode = async (parcelId) => {
  const code = crypto.randomBytes(3).toString('hex');
  await supabase
    .from('verification_codes')
    .insert({
      parcel_id: parcelId,
      code,
      expires_at: new Date(Date.now() + 24*60*60*1000)
    });
  return code;
};
```

This case scenario demonstrates the seamless integration of various features while maintaining a user-friendly experience throughout the delivery process.
